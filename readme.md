# SwitchBooks
SwitchBooks is an app that enables you to exchange your used books for someone else's used books. You may visit it at [https://switchbooks.herokuapp.com](https://switchbooks.herokuapp.com)

## How to use SwitchBooks?

You may view all the books that have been added by other users. But to add a book of your own, you need to signup to use the service. After signing up, you may add your own books and comment on other people's books. You may edit/delete the books or comments that you've added. If you find a book that you'd like to exchange for one of yours, simply send that person a switch request. Please note that you need to have added atleast one book of yours to send a switch request to other users.

You may view the requests that you've sent or recieved in the navbar while you're logged in. Whenever a user sends you a switch request for one of your books, you recieve an e-mail notifying you of the request.
